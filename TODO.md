### Secondary

- carefully run through the auth and data flow to look for bugs or oversights
- ensure that peer dependencies are met and npm throws errors if not
- add jest tests for all utils
- consider how to clean up old and unused lnauth session data that was created but never reached success state

### Tertiary

- decide on terminology (avatar or image or picture)
- add more example repos
- add spinner to Loading component
- open PR on `next-auth`
- add `auto` color scheme that uses browsers dark/light settings
- cancel inflight api requests if hook unmounts
- consider adding various styles of avatar and name generators

### Readme

- add yellow notes to diagram.
- add info about deterministic generation of image and name
- carefully scan for errors and typos
- see if config docs can be moved into TS file and autogenerated
- add examples/images showing generator outputs. e.g. bottts images
- ensure consistent formatting is used. full stops, caps, etc
