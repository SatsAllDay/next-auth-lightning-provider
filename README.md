# About

A light-weight Lightning auth provider for your Next.js app that's entirely self-hosted and plugs seamlessly into the [next-auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) framework.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This package is built for Next.js apps that use [next-auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth). It's not compatible with other authentication libraries.

# How it works

Install the package and add two code snippets to your app (as shown below). It's that simple.

Your users will then be shown an additional auth option in the `next-auth` sign in page. When they click the new option they'll be presented with a QR code. The QR code can be scanned with any Bitcoin Lightning wallet that supports `lnurl-auth`. After scanning, they'll be securely logged in! No username or password required.

Behind the scenes `next-auth-lightning-provider` sets up several API endpoint which act as a basic OAuth server. The API will authorize users with [lnurl-auth](https://fiatjaf.com/e0a35204.html) and then issue a JWT token to them.

As well as providing the basic authentication functionality that you'd expect, `next-auth-lightning-provider` also offers some extra functionality such as deterministicly generating avatars and usernames for authenticated users!

# Compatibility

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "next": "^12.2.5 || ^13 || ^14",
    "next-auth": "^4",
    "react": "^17.0.2 || ^18",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2 || ^18"
  }
}
```

# Getting started

### Install

```bash
npm i next-auth-lightning-provider
```

### Env

You'll need to setup a couple of env vars in your project's `.env` file. You may already have them defined as part of your `next-auth` configuration. This package also requires them.

---

The `NEXTAUTH_URL` env var must be defined as the canonical URL of your site.

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

The `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` env var must be defined as a securely generated random string.

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<super-secret-random-string>"
```

You can quickly create a good value for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` on the command line via this `openssl` command.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### API

Create a new API route under `pages/api/lnauth/[...lnauth].ts`

```typescript
// @/pages/api/lnauth/[...lnauth].ts

import NextAuthLightning, {
  LightningAuthSession,
  NextAuthLightningConfig,
} from "next-auth-lightning-provider";
import generateQr from "next-auth-lightning-provider/generators/qr";
import generateName from "next-auth-lightning-provider/generators/name";
import generateAvatar from "next-auth-lightning-provider/generators/avatar";

const config: NextAuthLightningConfig = {
  // required
  siteUrl: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL,
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
  storage: {
    async set({ k1, session }) {
      // save lnurl auth session data based on k1 id
    },
    async get({ k1 }) {
      // lookup and return lnurl auth session data based on k1 id
    },
    async update({ k1, session }) {
      // update lnurl auth session data based on k1 id
    },
    async delete({ k1 }) {
      // delete lnurl auth session data based on k1 id
    },
  },
  generateQr,

  // optional
  generateName,
  generateAvatar,
  theme: {
    colorScheme: "dark",
  },
};

const { provider, handler } = NextAuthLightning(config);

export const lightningProvider = provider;

export default handler;
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The above example uses the Pages Router. If your app uses the App Router then take a look at the [examples/app-router/](https://github.com/jowo-io/next-auth-lightning-provider/tree/main/examples/app-router/) example app.

This API will handle all of the Lightning auth API requests, such as generating QRs, handling callbacks, polling and issuing JWT auth tokens.

### Provider

In your existing `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` config file, import and add the Lightning provider to the provider array.

```typescript
// @/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

import { lightningProvider } from "../lnauth/[...lnauth]"; // <--- import the provider that's exported from the lnauth API route

export const authOptions: AuthOptions = {
  providers: [
    lightningProvider, // <--- and add the provider to the providers array
  ],
};

export default NextAuth(authOptions);
```

# Generators

Normally if you authenticate a user with `lnurl-auth`, all you'd know about the user is their unique ID (a `pubkey`). This package goes a step further and provides several generator functions that can be used to deterministically (the `pubkey` is used as a seed) generate avatars and usernames. That means you can show users a unique name and image that'll be associated with their account!

As well as the avatar and image generators, there's also a QR code generator.

The generators are tree-shakeable. If you don't need them, simply don't import them and they'll not be included in your app's bundle.

```typescript
import generateQr from "next-auth-lightning-provider/generators/qr";
import generateName from "next-auth-lightning-provider/generators/name";
import generateAvatar from "next-auth-lightning-provider/generators/avatar";
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can write your own generator functions if those provided don't suit your needs!
>
> Once you have configured the generator methods you can launch your dev server and test them locally on the diagnostics page:
>
> ```
> http://localhost:3000/api/lnauth/diagnostics
> ```

# Configuration

# Storage

The `lnurl-auth` spec requires that a user's Lightning wallet trigger a callback as part of the authentication flow. For this reason, it may be that the device that scan the QR (e.g. a mobile) is not the same device that's trying to authenticate (e.g. a desktop). So, we require session storage to persist some data and make it available across devices and ensure it's available when the callback is triggered.

Data can be stored in a medium of your choice. For example a database, a document store, or a session store. Here's an example using [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv):

```typescript
import { kv } from "@vercel/kv";

const config: NextAuthLightningConfig = {
  // ...
  storage: {
    async set({ k1, session }) {
      await kv.set(`k1:${k1}`, session);
    },
    async get({ k1 }) {
      return await kv.get(`k1:${k1}`);
    },
    async update({ k1, session }) {
      await kv.set(`k1:${k1}`, session);
    },
    async delete({ k1 }) {
      await kv.del(`k1:${k1}`);
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

See more working examples in the [examples/](https://github.com/jowo-io/next-auth-lightning-provider/tree/main/examples) folder.

Once you have configured the storage methods you can launch your dev server and test them locally on the diagnostics page:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/lnauth/diagnostics
```

You can also pass in your own custom session values via the query params:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/lnauth/diagnostics?k1=custom-k1&state=custom-state&pubkey=custom-pubkey&sig=custom-sig
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The diagnostics page will be **disabled** by default for production builds. To enable on production see the flags config options.

### Error page

By default users are sent to the default `next-auth` error page and a generic error message is shown.

The error page path can be overridden and a custom error page can be configured (See the pages config options).

The following error codes are passed via query parameter to the error page:

```typescript
enum ErrorCodes {
  //¬†An attempted API request was made to an auth endpoint while already logged in.
  Forbidden = "You are already logged in.",

  // An API request was made to a non existent `lnurl-auth` API path.
  NotFound = "Path not found.",

  // Authorizing the user failed because the `lnurl-auth` callback received an invalid `signature` / `pubkey`
  Unauthorized = "You could not be signed in.",

  // The user's session has been deleted. Either their session expired or they had a failed sign in attempt and must create a new session.
  Gone = "Session not found.",

  // An API request was made to the `lnurl-auth` APIs with a missing required query param or body arguments.
  BadRequest = "Missing required query or body arguments.",

  // Generic catch-all error code when one of the above errors is not matched.
  Default = "Unable to sign in.",
}
```

Example: `/error?error=Default&message=Unable+to+sign+in.`

# Next.js Routers

With the release of `next@v13` comes the App Router.

This package supports both the [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages) and the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

If your app uses the App Router, see the [examples/app-router/](https://github.com/jowo-io/next-auth-lightning-provider/tree/main/examples/app-router/) app.

If your app uses the Pages Router, see any of the other [examples/](https://github.com/jowo-io/next-auth-lightning-provider/tree/main/examples/) apps.
